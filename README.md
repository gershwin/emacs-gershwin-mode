# Emacs Major Mode for Gershwin #

The file `gershwin-mode.el` is a derived mode from `clojure-mode` that provides elementary support for the Gershwin programming language.

## Todos/Bugs ##

 * Colorize Gershwin builtins like builtins, not like keywords
 * Expand list of Gershwin builtins (ongoing as language is in development)
